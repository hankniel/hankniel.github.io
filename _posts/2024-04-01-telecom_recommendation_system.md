## Summary

The Telecom Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized product recommendations to customers of a telecom client. This real-world project encompasses the full development lifecycle of a recommendation engineâ€”from prototyping and testing the model, to deploying an API and managing the database.

## Techniques

The core of this project involves:

- **Prototyping**: Rapidly developing initial versions of the recommendation system to explore different approaches and refine our methods.
- **Model Testing**: Evaluating various recommendation models to ensure accuracy and effectiveness in personalizing customer interactions.
- **API Development**: Using Flask, a micro web framework written in Python, to build and deploy APIs that serve the recommendations to the client's systems.
- **Database Management**: Handling large datasets with PostgreSQL to store and manage user data, which is crucial for generating accurate recommendations.
- **Linux**: Utilizing Linux-based servers to host and run our applications, ensuring stability and performance.

## Role and Responsibilities

As the lead developer, my responsibilities include:

- Building the end-to-end system architecture.
- Developing and testing multiple recommendation models to find the most effective approach.
- Implementing the models into a functional API.
- Managing the PostgreSQL database to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
- Overseeing the deployment of our Flask-based API on the client's Linux servers.

## Outcome

The recommendation model has been fully developed and deployed. However, the ongoing phase of monitoring real-world usage and conducting A/B testing to fine-tune the model has not yet commenced. This next stage is crucial for adjusting the system to effectively meet real-world demands and improve the personalization of product recommendations.

Through this project, I have already gained valuable insights into the development of recommendation systems, including data processing, model building, and deployment strategies.
