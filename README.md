# My Data Science Portfolio

Hello! I am a hard-working, enthusiastic, and disciplined data scientist. I am currently a final-year student at Foreign Trade University. I have a strong interest in algorithms, math, and science. I am also a Python charmer, a maths lover, a wrangler of algorithms, but sometimes I believe in human intuition more than the numbers.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### [Fraud Detection](/projects/fraud_detection)

A comprehensive analysis of a dataset provided by Pizza Hut Vietnam. The analysis aims to provide insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and the effectiveness of various sales channels and strategies. I used Python and scikit-learn for this project.

### [Telecom Recommendation System](/projects/telecom_recommendation_system)

A real-world project to build a recommendation system for a telecom client. The project encompasses the full development lifecycle of a recommendation engineâ€”from prototyping and testing the model, to deploying an API and managing the database. The project is implemented using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and Linux.
